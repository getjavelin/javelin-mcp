## ‚Å†Local MCP server ‚¨Ñ Local Tools

Docker Desktop MCP Integration with their **MCP Catalog and Toolkit** provides:
1. **Centralized Discovery** - A trusted hub for discovering MCP tools integrated into Docker Hub
2. **Containerized Deployment** - Run MCP servers as containers without complex setup
3. **Secure Credential Management** - Centralized, encrypted credential handling
4. **Built-in Security** - Sandbox isolation and permissions management

The Docker MCP ecosystem includes over 100 verified tools from partners like Stripe, Elastic, Neo4j, and more, all accessible through Docker's infrastructure.

**sidenote:** Apps like Anthropic Claude currently **work only over stdio**, so a lightweight proxy layer is needed to expose them as MCP-compatible endpoints.

## ‚Å†Remote MCP server ‚¨Ñ Local (Builtin) Tools 

In the current Javelin MCP architecture, **tools are expected to be registered and executed remotely** (via an HTTP or gRPC endpoint). However, some tools (such as deterministic utilities or safe built-in actions) may be registered as **builtin tools**, which execute locally within the Javelin runtime.

While it is technically possible to have a remote MCP server route requests to local tools (co-located on the same host), this is not a typical or recommended deployment model.

### üí° Key Notes:
- Use **remote tools** for hosted, externally managed actions (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic).
- Use **builtin tools** for internal utilities or tightly coupled logic.
- A future enhancement may allow hybrid routing, but this is not standard today.
