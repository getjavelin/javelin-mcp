# Questions:

- How do you Authenticate and Authorize Agents themselves (outside the identity of the user on behalf of whom it runs)
- How do you pass OAuth Credentials for Agents to MCP servers does this go through Javelin or Are we a simple Proxy/Pass through or does this even happen outside Javelin flow
- Feasibility of using an mcp-proxy for all MCP flows - Are there any flows which may fall outside the MCP server Invocation ie go outside Javelin mcp-proxy
