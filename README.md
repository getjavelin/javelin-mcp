# Javelin MCP: Model Context Protocol & Agentic Systems Playground

Welcome to the Javelin MCP project! This repository is a comprehensive playground and resource hub for exploring, prototyping, and documenting best practices around the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, agentic AI systems, and secure, auditable agent-to-server communication.

## What is MCP?
**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an emerging standard for enabling secure, flexible, and auditable communication between AI agents, clients, and servers. MCP is designed to address the unique challenges of agent identity, authentication, authorization, and trust in modern cloud and enterprise environments.

## Project Purpose
This project brings together:
- **Research & Documentation** on agent identity, trust, and security in OAuth/OIDC systems
- **Integration Patterns** for LLMs, agents, and MCP clients/servers
- **Curated Resources** for MCP tools, SDKs, and agentic development
- **Experimental Code & Labs** for new architectures and security models

## Repository Structure

### Core Components
- **playground/agents/**: Integration patterns and resources for building AI agents with MCP
