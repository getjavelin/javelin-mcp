# Solving the Agent Identity Problem in OAuth/OIDC Systems

## Executive Summary

Identity standards such as OpenID Connect (OIDC) and OAuth 2.0 provide robust mechanisms for
authentication and authorization in traditional user-centric scenarios. However, the emergence
of agentic systems has revealed critical gaps in these protocols when AI agents need to access
user data.

This document presents a comprehensive but high level solution to address the unique challenges of
agent identity management, building upon the security considerations outlined in the [Model
Context Protocol (MCP) Security Best Practices Specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/basic/security_best_practices).
