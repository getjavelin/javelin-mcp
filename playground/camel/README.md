# 🐪 CaMeL: Defeating Prompt Injections by Design

Implementation of the CaMeL (short for **CA**pabilities for **M**achin**E** **L**earning) system from the paper (_125 Pages_) ["Defeating Prompt Injections by Design" by Debenedetti et al. (2025).](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.18813)

- CaMeL is short for CApabilities for MachinE Learning.
- Here the term **capability** refers to the standard security definition, and not the standard machine learning measurement of how capable models are.

**So, are prompt injections solved now?**
**No, prompt injection attacks are not fully solved.** While CaMeL significantly improves the security
of LLM agents against prompt injection attacks and allows for fine-grained policy enforcement, it
is not without limitations. Importantly, CaMeL suffers from users needing to codify and specify
security policies and maintain them. CaMeL also comes with a user burden. At the same time, it is
well known that balancing security with user experience, especially with de-classification and user
fatigue, is challenging. We also explicitly acknowledge the potential for side-channel vulnerabilities in
CaMeL; however, we do note that their successful exploitation is significantly hindered by bandwidth
limitations and the involved attack complexity.

**And is [AgentDojo](https://agentdojo.spylab.ai/) fully solved now? Not exactly.** While CaMeL offers robust security guarantees
and demonstrates resilience against existing prompt injection attacks within AgentDojo benchmark, it
would be inaccurate to claim a complete resolution. Rather, our approach diverges from prior efforts,
focusing on building model scaffolding rather than improving the model. Furthermore, existing
research predominantly aims to optimize utility while mitigating attack success rates. In contrast,
our focus is on establishing verifiable security guarantees while concurrently maximizing utility. We
firmly believe that by adopting CaMeL as a fundamental design paradigm, future research will unlock
substantial enhancements in utility.

## Architecture

```
User Query → P-LLM → Python Code → CaMeL Interpreter → Secure Execution

                                  Q-LLM (for untrusted data)
```

## Installation

## Usage

## Security Guarantees

- **Control Flow Isolation**: Untrusted data cannot affect control flow
- **Data Exfiltration Prevention**: Capabilities prevent unauthorized data exfiltration  
- **Policy Enforcement**: Custom interpreter enforces security policies
- **LLM Isolation**: Dual LLM pattern isolates planning from data processing
- **Lethal Trifecta Protection**: Defends against attacks combining private data access, untrusted content, and external communication
