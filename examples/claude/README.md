## ⁠Local MCP server with the local Tools

[Docker Desktop MCP Integration](https://www.docker.com/blog/introducing-docker-mcp-catalog-and-toolkit/) with their [**MCP Catalog and Toolkit**](https://docs.docker.com/ai/mcp-catalog-and-toolkit/) provides:

1. **Centralized Discovery** - A trusted hub for discovering MCP tools integrated into Docker Hub
2. **Containerized Deployment** - Run MCP servers as containers without complex setup
3. **Secure Credential Management** - Centralized, encrypted credential handling
4. **Built-in Security** - Sandbox isolation and permissions management

The Docker MCP ecosystem includes over 100 verified tools from partners like Stripe, Elastic, Neo4j, and more, all accessible through Docker's infrastructure.
