# Identity Frameworks and Trust Architectures for Agentic Systems: *A Strategic Imperative for Enterprise Adoption*

## Executive Summary

The proliferation of autonomous agentic systems presents unprecedented challenges in enterprise
identity and access management (IAM). These systems require novel approaches to trust
establishment, authentication, and authorization that extend beyond traditional user-centric
models. This analysis examines the fundamental security requirements for treating agents as
first-class entities within existing identity frameworks and proposes strategic extensions to
established standards.

## Introduction

The emergence of agentic systems has introduced complex security paradigms that necessitate
treating agents as independent entities with distinct identity requirements. A critical
challenge to emphasize is the foundational need for a two-way trust: determining the extent to
which these agents can be trusted with delegated authority, while simultaneously ensuring
agents can authenticate and authorize the entities they must interact with to fulfill
their operational mandates.

Recent research in zero-trust identity frameworks for agentic AI has highlighted the inadequacy
of traditional IAM systems for autonomous agents, emphasizing the need for specialized identity
management approaches that address the unique characteristics of agent-based interactions.

## Reasoning Framework

The defining characteristic of an agent is its autonomous decision-making capability—the
capacity to execute actions based on independent reasoning rather than direct human instruction.
This autonomy creates functional parallels with human users in terms of system interaction
patterns and security requirements. Both entities require established digital identities that
define their permitted actions within organizational systems.

OpenID Connect (OIDC) and OAuth 2.0 represent the industry-standard protocols for
authentication and authorization, providing mature frameworks for managing user access to
protected resources. Within these specifications, the concept of a "client" bears significant
similarity to agentic systems. Clients are applications that operate under organizational
supervision and perform system actions on behalf of users—a functional description that closely
aligns with many agent use cases.

Current research proposes extending OIDC frameworks to include agent-specific identity and
delegation mechanisms, suggesting that agents can be conceptualized as specialized clients
within existing protocol architectures.

## Strategic Challenges

### Dynamic Registration

OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration Protocol (RFC 7591) provides standardized mechanisms for
programmatic client registration, addressing some registration challenges through API-based
approaches. However, traditional registration processes—whether manual or dynamic—assume
relatively static operational patterns and predetermined interaction requirements.

The challenge becomes more acute with agentic systems due to their dynamic operational nature.
Unlike conventional applications with well-defined integration requirements, agents may require
access to previously unknown resources or services as they adapt to evolving tasks. This
dynamic behavior complicates advance registration processes and challenges traditional approval
workflows.

Revealing dynamic client registration endpoints brings security risks that demand attention.
One risk is the potential for resource depletion, which, if not addressed, could trigger a
Denial of Service (DoS) attack. A preferred solution is to protect these endpoints with OAuth
access tokens, though this poses initialization hurdles for newly created agents without prior
credentials. Furthermore, security concerns around uncontrolled client proliferation have
limited widespread adoption of dynamic registration capabilities in enterprise environments.

Even if all issues with dynamic client registration are resolved, a deeper question persists:
how can organizations effectively confirm the good standing of autonomous agents requesting
registrations while upholding security standards and operational control? Whether the
registration is handled manually or programmatically is beside the point, as even manual
registrations demand assurances of the agents' legitimacy.

### Trust Establishment

Authentication alone lays a weak groundwork for operational trust. While it verifies that an
entity's identity matches prior interactions, it fails to tackle the core issue of
trustworthiness—whether an agent can be fully relied upon to legitimately carry out its tasks.
Similarly, authorization only determines what an authenticated entity is permitted to do, not
whether it should be granted those permissions to begin with.

Trust establishment is the process that addresses this exact question. Yet, the answer is not
fixed, as it may evolve over time. Trust establishment is an ongoing, unending journey that
begins at registration with an initial evaluation of trustworthiness, often based on verifying
a trust chain. This can then be enriched with multiple factors, such as operational history,
behavior, and compliance with security policies. This multifaceted trust evaluation demands
advanced monitoring and assessment capabilities that go beyond conventional binary access
control models.

Contemporary approaches propose the use of dynamic trust scoring mechanisms based among other
things on agent provenance, behavior patterns, anomaly detection, and security posture
assessments. These mechanisms enable an adaptability layer built on risk-based access decisions
where high-trust agents may receive broader operational privileges while potentially compromised or
untested agents operate under restrictive policies.

### Ownership and Accountability

The deployment of agentic systems in enterprise settings requires robust accountability
mechanisms. Agents cannot function as autonomous entities without organizational oversight and
clear responsibility structures. Each agent must uphold traceable connections with accountable
organizational entities—such as business units, applications, or individual users—that take
responsibility for the agents' actions.

This accountability requirement calls for architectural strategies to represent
agent-client-user relationships within existing identity frameworks, such as OIDC and OAuth.
Without delving into an exhaustive analysis of possible options, two clear approaches emerge:

1. **Extended Client Model**: Viewing agents as specialized OAuth clients with improved
capabilities for linking user and client entities with their agents.
2. **Refined Entity Model**: Recognizing agents as unique entity types with defined ownership and
control connections to established clients and/or users.

Both approaches require extensions to the existing OIDC and OAuth 2.0 core specifications to
accommodate the need for entity relationship management as well as delegation patterns.

### Trust Chain

Trust chains are used as a tool for trust establishment. They offer well-established and
reliable methods for depicting hierarchical trust relationships, with implementations spanning
from X.509 certificate chains to the emerging OpenID Federation trust chains. Within agentic
systems, trust chains hold the potential to allow client entities to endorse their associated
agents while delivering verifiable attestation through trusted anchor entities.

The trust chain model addresses several critical requirements:

- **Provenance Verification**: Establishing the legitimate organizational source of agent
deployments
- **Hierarchical Accountability**: Maintaining clear responsibility chains from agents to
accountable entities
- **Scalable Trust Propagation**: Enabling trust decisions based on established anchor
relationships rather than individual agent assessment

Employing trust chain frameworks within ecosystems featuring a complex network of relationships
among entities offers a robust and, crucially, scalable foundation for building distributed
trust relationships that can be readily adapted for agent identity management.

Examples of applicable trust chain technologies include:

- **IETF X.509 Certificate Chains**: Providing cryptographic attestation of entity relationships
through established certificate authorities
- **OIDF OpenID Federation**: Enabling federated trust relationships between identity providers and
relying parties without direct pre-configuration
- **W3C Verifiable Credentials**: Supporting portable, cryptographically verifiable attestations
of entity attributes and relationships

## Proposed Solution Architecture

The proliferation of agentic systems requires immediate solutions that extend existing OAuth 2.0
and OIDC protocols to address identified challenges. Current specifications lack standardized
approaches for agent identity management, necessitating custom protocol extensions that maintain
compatibility with existing infrastructure while adding agent-specific capabilities.

The proposed solution tackles two main issues: First, the dynamic nature of agents requiring
the establishment of new relationships while carrying out their tasks. Second, the need to
consistently assess, through programmatic means, the degree of trust that can be placed in the
agent.

A potential implementation approach to meet these requirements involves adopting the protocol
outlined in the OpenID Federation specification, a new standard under development by the OIDF.
This standard offers a framework for integrating registrations into
authentication-authorization processes, leveraging a trust chain as defined by the specification.

### Dynamic Agent-Client-User Relationship Management

Implementation of standardized APIs for declaring and managing agent-client-user relationships
would enable:

- **Programmatic Registration**: Automated agent onboarding processes that reduce manual
administrative overhead
- **Relationship Attestation**: Cryptographic proof of legitimate agent-client-user associations
- **Lifecycle Management**: Dynamic modification of agent permissions and relationships based
on operational requirements

These APIs would extend existing dynamic client registration capabilities to support
agent-specific metadata including operational scope, trust level, and accountability relationships.

In the previously mentioned OpenID Federation, a client could be dynamically and explicitly
registered through a dedicated API, or the dynamic registration could be conducted within the
standard Authorization Requests (AR) or Pushed Authorization Requests (PAR) APIs.

### Automated Trust Verification

Integration of trust chain verification within registration and authentication-authorization flows
would enable:

- **Automated Vetting**: Verification of agent legitimacy through established trust anchors
without manual intervention
- **Risk-Based Assessment**: Dynamic trust scoring based on chain strength and historical
performance
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Ongoing trust evaluation throughout agent operational lifecycles

This approach requires organizations to establish relationships with trusted anchor entities
and implement verification mechanisms within their authorization servers and identity providers.

Supported by the OpenID Federation specification, an existing trust chain can be specified
within the Authorization Request (AR) and Pushed Authorization Request (PAR) APIs. The
Authorization Server or Identity Provider can then assess this trust chain to gauge the level
of trust to place in the previously unknown agent. This specification also defines the required
elements for creating that trust chain.

## Implementation Considerations

Enterprise adoption of agent identity frameworks requires careful attention to several
operational factors:

### Infrastructure Compatibility

Extensions defined by the solution must maintain backward compatibility with existing OAuth 2.0 and
OIDC implementations while providing clear migration paths, for organizations adopting agent
technologies, once standardized mechanisms are established. This suggests an incremental approach
where agent-specific features are implemented as optional protocol extensions.

### Performance and Scalability

Agent identity management systems must support high-volume, low-latency authentication and
authorization operations as agents may require frequent resource access during task execution.
Traditional user-centric identity systems may require architectural modifications to handle
agent interaction patterns efficiently.

### Monitoring and Audit Requirements

Enterprise compliance requirements necessitate comprehensive audit trails for agent actions.
Identity frameworks must provide detailed logging of agent authentication, authorization
decisions, and resource access patterns to support regulatory compliance and security incident
investigation.

## Conclusion

The strategic adoption of agentic systems within enterprise environments requires immediate
attention to identity and access management challenges that extend beyond traditional
user-centric models. Current OAuth 2.0 and OIDC standards provide foundational capabilities but
require targeted extensions to address the unique trust, accountability, and operational
requirements of autonomous agents.

Organizations planning agent deployments should prioritize the development of comprehensive
identity frameworks that address dynamic registration challenges, establish robust trust
verification mechanisms, and maintain clear accountability relationships. The integration of
established trust chain technologies provides a path forward that leverages existing
cryptographic infrastructure while addressing the novel requirements of agent-based systems.

Success in this domain requires collaboration between identity management teams, security
architects, and application developers to ensure that agent identity frameworks align with
organizational security policies while enabling the operational flexibility that makes agentic
systems valuable.

The time for addressing these challenges is now—as organizations increasingly deploy autonomous
agents, the absence of robust identity frameworks creates significant security risks and
operational limitations that will become increasingly difficult to remediate retroactively.
